<!-- <h3> Research approach and topics </h3> -->
	  
	
<p>

My research spans two themes - the first focuses on designing technology-enhanced learning environments to address student learning of disciplinary practices, and the second relates to the effective integration of technology by teachers. 
</p>

<h4>Technology Enhanced Learning of Disciplinary Practices (TELeaD)</h4>

<p>An important goal of education is that in addition to content, students develop disciplinary practices such as design thinking, systems thinking, divergent-convergent thinking, question-posing, estimation, modeling and so on. Learners are expected to use these practices for sense-making and problem-solving within and across various disciplines, in educational settings and in the workplace. Using a design-based research approach, we design and implement technology enhanced learning environments to promote disciplinary practices among undergraduate students.

<h4>Teacher use of educational technology</h4>
<p>
The potential of educational technology tools is lost without integration appropriate pedagogical strategies. Instructors not only need to have a knowledge of which tools are relevant, but more importantly how to integrate them effectively in the teaching-learning process. This research has led to the creation of frameworks and models for effective integration of ET tools, designs for faculty professional development programs and development of technology enhanced learning systems for instructors to create meaningful learning designs.
